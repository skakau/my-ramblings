## Who am I  
- New Zealand born.  
- Lived in SWE for 15+ years (still can't speak Swedish)  
- Studied Computer Science  
- Writing `if statements` since 2008  
- EM at Kry.  
- Hybrid worker  
  
## The basics  
My name is Shane Kakau, I speak English but can follow along in Swedish and have somewhat of a grasp on when I should nod and say *hmmm* in a conversation.  
  
I have been developing software for sometime now primarily as a web developer. I enjoy all facets of the discipline and like to explore and try out new stuff all the time. I love this part of what we do. Learning!!!  
  
I have recently moved into management with the goal of helping people fine tune their skill sets and help reach their goals. I believe with my technical background and the want to help people to succeed in their personal development I hope to be successful at this.  
  
I work mostly from home but you will find me in the office typically every other week for a few days.  
  
## My working hours  
Mo: 08:00 - 17:00  
Tu: 08:00 - 17:00  
We: 08:00 - 17:00  
Th: 08:00 - 17:00  
Fr: 08:00 - 15:00  
  
**NB:** Every second week (Thur-Thur) I have the kids, which means some days may end sooner (due to after school activities and the like). I can be reached via my preferred communication channels but response times may vary. These out of office times will be reflected in my calendar.  
  
## My Communication Channel preferences  
![Pasted image 20230518094750.png](./img/Pasted%20image%2020230518094750.png#) Slack is my preferred tool of communication and is where you will most likely get a response from me. Recommend, 10/10.  
  
Please note that due to above working times I may respond/send slack messages out of office hours. I do not expect replies and want to respect your time as well, its just this is when I sometimes prefer to catch up on conversations.  
  
![Pasted image 20230518094931.png](./img/Pasted%20image%2020230518094931.png#) Email is where communication goes to die and never been seen or read. Do not recommend, 1/10  
  
## Preferred working conditions  
While at home, anything goes and I like my setup. This is my safe place. I also have a cat which you will hear screaming in the background from time-to-time. I apologise in advance for this.  
  
When at the office, I prefer open space working, as I often find that actively listening to conversations around me is a great way to passively learn and maybe, just maybe I can even contribute to it (if my input is needed or wanted).  
  
If I need my time, I will typically find a phone booth or simply put the headphones on. I don't mind being interrupted but if it is really bad timing or I am close to solving *todays* problem then I will politely let you know I will be with you in a minute.  
  
## Giving feedback  
I like all types of feedback and believe this is an important method for helping us to grow and develop. I would rather have a difficult conversation about something that I may done or said in the moment (or privately afterwards if you prefer) than to let things go unspoken.  
  
I prefer face-to-face feedback as I think this is the ultimate communication tool and dealing with feedback.  
  
When giving feedback I try to be direct and honest. Of course feedback can be opinionated and I  am very mindful of this when doing it, thus I appreciate the dialog between both parties that takes place during these conversations.  
  
## Things I need  
- I like to be part of all aspects of Software Engineering and love to collaborate with teams on problems to be solved. I love making sense of chaos.  
- Time. I try not to talk for the sake of talking and often think about whats being said in real-time. Therefore I am not always have my thoughts formulated and ready to be shared. I understand in certain circumstances quick decisions need to be made but I prefer to think about things a little longer if conditions allow.  
- Finding solutions fast. I believe much more can be gained in getting something to work first than coming up with the perfect solution first. I like to iterate on ideas and concepts and believe the feedback loop of trying things out brings me much more information than hypothesising for a long period of time.  
- Note taking. I take a lot of notes during the day. I don't always have the mental time or capacity to process everything that is being said or done, so at the end of the day I like to sit down and go though these things to understand what happened during the day.  
  
## What I find exciting  
- Learning from others. If I am the smartest person in the room then I am in the wrong room.  
- Problem solving as a team. I love when working together to solve problems and get energy from the process as we all contribute to the solution.  
- Seeing people succeed and do well.  
- Teaching. I love sharing my knowledge and experiences with others in the hope they find a little bit *something* in it to help them grow and learn.  
  
## Troubleshooting  
  
**Q: Why isn’t Shane responding?**  
  
**A:** If its out office hours then you probably know why, if its during office hours I do make a note of things I need to follow up on throughout the day. I will get back to you I just need to make sure I have the time to process everything in a focussed way.  
  
**Q: Why is Shane sending me a slack message at 22:00?**  
  
**A:** Sorry, but often during the day I will take notes of things I need to follow up with, typically in the evening is when I find the best time to digest and process these things. I do not expect things to be read or be responded to.  
  
**Q: Why is Shane writing while we’re talking?**  
  
**A:** I am probably taking notes to follow up on later with.
