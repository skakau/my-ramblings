## Who am I
- New Zealand born.
- Lived in SWE for 15+ years (still can't speak Swedish)
- Studied at IT University in Gothenburg SE
- Developing for 12+ years (and I still suck at it)
- EM at Kry.


## Working hours
My typical working hours are 8:30-17:00.

I have two kids every other week (Thur-Thur) during which time I maybe unavailable after 15:30 due to school activities and the like. Typically I will have my phone with me and will get back to you but I may take a little longer. I humbly request you don't schedule meetings during this time in which you need me to actively participate by talking, viewing Miro boards, etc as this can be very distrusting when trying to be done on a mobile phone and in large public spaces for all involved. If you however just need me to listen then feel free to send me an invite.

Because my working hrs can vary then you can sometimes expect me to send slack messages, emails during weird out-of-office hours. I don't expect replies its just that during this time is when I often catch up on missed conversations or questions.

## Getting a hold of me
Hit me up on Slack. I will typically respond within a hr (max) during office hours 9-17 CEST. I do work during the morning and night and don't mind getting messages outside of office hours I just might take a bit longer in responding.
