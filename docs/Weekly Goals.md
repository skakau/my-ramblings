**Reflection on week**  
- Week went well, was able to have some productive meetings at the beginning which set the stage for the rest of the week and provide clarity on dependant meetings.  
- Team work still ongoing but starting to see the need from teams for kick offs.  
- Was able to take a decision on the future of ML and the work needed to get live and operational in prod. Sadly we decided to park this initiative due to the work required from other teams and no real obvious improvements.  
- TakeCare Cal integration work still on-going. Could this be the rebirth of project hydra???
