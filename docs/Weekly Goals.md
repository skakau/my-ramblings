**Reflection on week**  
- Week went well, was able to have some productive meetings at the beginning which set the stage for the rest of the week and provide clarity on dependant meetings.  
- Team work still ongoing but starting to see the need from teams for kick offs.  
- Was able to take a decision on the future of ML and the work needed to get live and operational in prod. Sadly we decided to park this initiative due to the work required from other teams and no real obvious improvements.  
- TakeCare Cal integration work still on-going. Could this be the rebirth of project hydra???

**Reflection on week**  
Was able to work with a bit regarding the NLL db encryption and understand some more about kms keys work, which was nice. But I think the complexity of running this service in Elastx made it harder to grab a simple concept (such as KMS) because of we "connect" to AWS accounts from Elastx and thus the privileges required to read such keys.  
  
Teams were introduced got some feedback regarding UX writers which was an unintentional mistake on my behalf, also left Karl off the picture. Sorry Karl.  
  
Still haven't booked meetings, but plan on starting this next week.
