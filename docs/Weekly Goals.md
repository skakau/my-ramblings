## W24: June 12 - June 16 2023  
**Goals**  
- Prepare vision and alignment for CAM âœ…  
- Start booking reoccurring 1:1's âœ…  
- Start team-medication handover with Sandra âœ…  
  
**Reflection on week**  
- Week went well, was able to have some productive meetings at the beginning which set the stage for the rest of the week and provide clarity on dependant meetings.  
- Team work still ongoing but starting to see the need from teams for kick offs.  
- Was able to take a decision on the future of ML and the work needed to get live and operational in prod. Sadly we decided to park this initiative due to the work required from other teams and no real obvious improvements.  
- TakeCare Cal integration work still on-going. Could this be the rebirth of project hydra???  
  
## W25 June 19 - June 23 2023  
**Goals**  
- Finalise new team structures  
- Begin reaching out to new reports  
- Write some code  
  
**Reflection on week**  
Was able to work with a bit regarding the NLL db encryption and understand some more about kms keys work, which was nice. But I think the complexity of running this service in Elastx made it harder to grab a simple concept (such as KMS) because of we "connect" to AWS accounts from Elastx and thus the privileges required to read such keys.  
  
Teams were introduced got some feedback regarding UX writers which was an unintentional mistake on my behalf, also left Karl off the picture. Sorry Karl.  
  
Still haven't booked meetings, but plan on starting this next week.  
  
## W26 June 26 - June 30 2023  
**Goals**

- Learn a bit more about AS  
- Discuss with CAM team about future  
  
**Reflection on week**  
Some good discussions for Encounters team, which is now called team-clinician-core. Still going through with each persons "old teams" backlog to identify what the new team will own and work with. Also had a team workshop working the Miro board to identify new opportunities, together with these tasks and old one we hope to build a roadmap.  
  
Booked some meetings/workshops for CAM team after a few private discussions with the team about roadmap and objective of the team.

**Reflection on week**  
Finally met everyone and then at the same time cancelled all 1:1s. Looking at coming up with a new WoW for after the summer.  
  
Spent some time going through Clinician Core miro board to answer any open questions about work identified as ideal for the team to work on. This meant refining cost/effort benefits, impact on P/L etc.  
  
Started formalising how we want to present our business case for why we want to continue CP1 migration work. Not sure of the best strategy yet, maybe an ADR. Will bring it up more in following meetings with tech management.  
  
Started working on my career matrix to define what I actually do and areas to improve on.
