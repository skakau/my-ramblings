## W36 September 04 - September 08 2023  
**Goals**  
- Team workshop days for Pat Eng and Web Infra  
- Allocate additional "focus time" on learning more about Cava and Appt domain (due to Moses going on parental leave).  
- Work with Blackbeard devs on planning tech roadmap for their domain.

**Reflection on week**  
Was a good week actually. Was involved in more technical discussions (its been a minute). Reminded me how much I enjoy that "side" of my role. Made a mental note to myself to try and steer the ship more in that direction going forward (the ship being my work)  
  
I am excited about the rebirth of project Hydra and with a few tweaks to the plan (i.e proper milestones, deliverables) I think we can get this moving forward. However since we are driving this from a tech improvement angle its the devs opinion that probably holds the most weight it "next steps"   
  
  
## W35 August 28 - September 1 2023  
**Goals**  
- Prep for team day

- Catch up with CAM to get feedback on how things are going now they are merged with Blackbeards.  
  
**Reflection on week**  
Still spent a lot of time on 1:1s as I continue to catch up with people. Team day for CC and üè¥‚Äç‚ò†Ô∏è was great, had a lot of fun and it was good to see so many people in the office. We didn't exactly get to do the work we had planned out (i.e WoW) but it was great to hear peoples stories during the ice-breaker exercises as well as the fun we had during the team battles.  
  
Need to keep this a regular thing!!

## W29 July 17 - July 21 2023  
**Goals**  
- Probably spend most of the week catching on last week  
- I have a lot of Workday tasks outstanding, so theres that  
- Prepare for off boarding/exit interviews.  
- Prepare for vacation of w30 and w31. ie Making sure everyone has everything they need.  
  
**Reflection on week**  
Week was productive, spent some time doing off boarding and Workday tasks. Not the funnest thing but needed.  
  
Starting to work with the idea of needing to formulate what we want to do from the bottom up to fix / unlock opportunities from a tech strategy perspective.  
  
Another goal that has been identified for me and that I feel is important is restoring the RnD culture. This is important to build back up the community feeling and a sense of togetherness.  
  
## W28 July 10 - July 14 2023  
On üå¥  
  
## W26 June 26 - June 30 2023  
**Goals**  
- Kick off with new Encounters team  
- Learn a bit more about AS  
- Discuss with CAM team about future  
  
**Reflection on week**  
Some good discussions for Encounters team, which is now called team-clinician-core. Still going through with each persons "old teams" backlog to identify what the new team will own and work with. Also had a team workshop working the Miro board to identify new opportunities, together with these tasks and old one we hope to build a roadmap.  
  
Booked some meetings/workshops for CAM team after a few private discussions with the team about roadmap and objective of the team.  
  
## W25 June 19 - June 23 2023  
**Goals**  
- Finalise new team structures  
- Begin reaching out to new reports  
- Write some code  
  
**Reflection on week**  
Was able to work with a bit regarding the NLL db encryption and understand some more about kms keys work, which was nice. But I think the complexity of running this service in Elastx made it harder to grab a simple concept (such as KMS) because of we "connect" to AWS accounts from Elastx and thus the privileges required to read such keys.  
  
Teams were introduced got some feedback regarding UX writers which was an unintentional mistake on my behalf, also left Karl off the picture. Sorry Karl.  
  
Still haven't booked meetings, but plan on starting this next week.  
  
## W24: June 12 - June 16 2023  
**Goals**  
- Prepare vision and alignment for CAM ‚úÖ  
- Start booking reoccurring 1:1's ‚úÖ  
- Start team-medication handover with Sandra ‚úÖ  
  
**Reflection on week**  
- Week went well, was able to have some productive meetings at the beginning which set the stage for the rest of the week and provide clarity on dependant meetings.  
- Team work still ongoing but starting to see the need from teams for kick offs.  
- Was able to take a decision on the future of ML and the work needed to get live and operational in prod. Sadly we decided to park this initiative due to the work required from other teams and no real obvious improvements.  
- TakeCare Cal integration work still on-going. Could this be the rebirth of project hydra???  
  
  
  
  
  
## W27 July 03 - July 07 2023  
**Goals**  
- Present some new ideas to CAM for work streams  
- Map out current responsibilities according to career matrix  
- Continue to meet new reports  
- Finish processing all old backlogs from disfunct teams  
- Start formulating a plan for CP 1 migration to be presented to tech group  
  
**Reflection on week**  
Finally met everyone and then at the same time cancelled all 1:1s. Looking at coming up with a new WoW for after the summer.  
  
Spent some time going through Clinician Core miro board to answer any open questions about work identified as ideal for the team to work on. This meant refining cost/effort benefits, impact on P/L etc.  
  
Started formalising how we want to present our business case for why we want to continue CP1 migration work. Not sure of the best strategy yet, maybe an ADR. Will bring it up more in following meetings with tech management.  
  
Started working on my career matrix to define what I actually do and areas to improve on.
