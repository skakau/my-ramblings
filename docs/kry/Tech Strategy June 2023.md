## Preface  
These are my opinions only. Additionally this is just my current reflections on things and by no means set in stone or well thought out ðŸ˜€  
  
## Introduction  
With the reduction in roles we will have a tough and challenging time ahead of us within the tech organisation. A lot of experience and knowledge of different domains, markets and responsibilities will need to be covered and filled. We understand that many people will have not only lost colleagues  but also friends and mentors.  
  
Going forward I still believe we can be successful and turn the corner to become profitable. This responsibility does not just lie with one person but all of us within the RnD. Everyone that has been asked to continue with us has been identified at playing an important role in this journey.  
  
We know that this will be a difficult and challenging time for all but everyone here has been asked to stay because we all believe you can show grit and commitment in stepping up to the challenges that we may face. However its just as important for us to have fun. So lets not forget to smile, laugh and have fun.  
  
## Team Structures  
Initially we should aim at keeping changes to a minimum in order to maintain a level of calmness and stability during these tough times.   
  
To which we will look at having the following setup.  
(still under construction)  
  
However with the lost of talent we collectively will be required to cover various areas and responsibilities that go beyond our typical boundaries of team ownership. This may include tech leads forming small lived working groups to address objectives that can have a direct impact on our profitability.  
For example: Tech lead investigates, plans and forms a small working group that aims at removing Contentful. Or tech lead forms a small group of 2-3 people from various areas and starts shutting down test-envs and so on.  
  
Another proposal that is under consideration could be having on-call teams for the week monitoring the domain channels to support with bugs and questions. This could allow the teams to remain focussed on the weeks goals and removing the need to context switch between development and support and at the same time on-call working on improving low hanging fruit, stabilising services, removing old services, addressing DD alerts/monitors and general service maintenance.  
  
However above all we must aim at maintaining some form of stability with clear focus and goals but it must not come at the scarfice of being being agile, forming, moving and acting quickly on initiatives that we identify as important to our success.  
  
## Communication  
In order to minimise miss communication or the need to monitor and cover multiple channels regarding news, updates, releases, bugs, questions, etc we should look archiving various channels.   
  
For example: using the dev channel for all comms and archiving dev-important, dev-release, dev-announcements.  
  
We will still encourage teams to have the own team channel for internal comms but look at having domain channels in which various stakeholders can post to in order to feel like they have somewhere to post a question and to avoid people searching or guessing about where to post a question.  
  
## Goals and Objectives  
Information regarding the roadmap for the Q3 and prioritise: TBD  
Possible items....  
- KTLO  
- Tech improvements that affect bottom line  
	- SMS improvements  
	- Closing down test envs  
	- Removing lokalise/contentful with own solution (backwards compatible)???  
	- Shutting down services.  
	- AI??  
	  
Tony and Olof to lead and direct here.  
  
## Support and On-Call  
Johan and Matthieu leading this initiative and will work closely with devs to come up a revised WoW and structure that will be suited to our new setup.
